More than 3 00 police trainees have not had DNA samples taken, yet these are needed to stop criminals from entering the South African Police Service (SAPS). The trainees joined SAPS academies last year and graduated in December. They are now serving their 12-month probation period. Background and fingerprint checks have been done, but DNA swabbing also helps to identify anyone linked to evidence gathered at crime scenes. Although Police Minister Bheki Cele’s office attempted to downplay the failure to take DNA samples, saying they could be taken at any stage during training, police members and an MP who was involved in drafting new legislation to introduce mandatory DNA sampling of the police described it as “outrageous”, “disheartening” and “gross negligence”. The Criminal Law (Forensic Procedures) Amendment Act of 2013 requires that samples be taken from all police members and added to an elimination index on the national database so that the DNA of any members can be quickly identified if it’s picked up at crime scenes.
