On Thursday January 10, the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) passed the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill and it will now be referred to the president for assent, after which it will become law. The Democratic Alliance proposed two amendments to the Bill: After submitting our proposed amendments to the secretary and the chairperson of the NCOP, they were added to the order paper for the day, which should have allowed for the full sitting of members to consider the material substance of such proposals during the plenary. Unfortunately, during the sitting, NCOP chairperson Thandi Modise ruled that she would refuse to allow the proposed amendments to be considered by the members present for procedural reasons.
