The appointment of a company to look into the spiralling irregular expenditure by the department of water and sanitation was in “flagrant disregard of the law”, according to an internal audit. The department’s former acting director general, Sifiso Mkhize, is being investigated for fraud for his alleged role in hiring Fumile Advisory Services for more than R60-million without going through the proper processes. Mkhize was appointed to the post in 2017 and was removed in June last year. He resigned shortly afterwards.
