Legend has it that there was a rich man who was so stingy he died of hunger with money in his pocket. The man spent each day admiring his treasures and resisting the temptation to spend money on sustenance. This story resembles that of residents of the Xolobeni area on the Wild Coast in the Eastern Cape, embroiled in a decade-long battle against the mining of their land.
