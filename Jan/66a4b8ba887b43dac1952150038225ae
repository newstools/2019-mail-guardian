At artist Thokozani Mthiyane’s U-shaped flat in Doornfontein, I was overwhelmed by his space, his artworks everywhere and how the light was coming in. The challenge was to find a spot that would depict what Mthiyane was about. I talk to people I’m photographing to gauge their mood and to involve them.
Portraiture demands participation or magic will not be achieved. I immediately found the right spot for him. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>The sun was diagonal and the room perfectly lit through big windows, which diffused the light slightly. A large part of the room was dimly lit, but one could still see paintings on the wall, oils on the table, an easel on the floor. Because I was using natural light, I had to ask him to sit down to get the light on him, especially his face. I exposed for the highlights to get details on his face, in line with where the light was coming in. Because of his co-operation, it was easy to photograph him. We did a few frames with him looking at the camera or looking away before we came to this one. He crossed his legs and I asked him to look outside. This shot soothes my heart and reminds me of the privilege I have to call what I love to do work.— Oupa Nkosi
