My creative-writing process begins with me wanting to tell a story. I call myself a storyteller by passion and an analyst by profession.
Once I have decided on the story, I then decide who are the people to carry it. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>Characterisation is an important part of my process, which begins with me giving birth to the characters. With painstaking detail I pick names, birth dates, star signs, hobbies, et cetera. This makes them more real, not just to me, but for the reader. Sometimes the character becomes bigger than I intended. This happened with Joyce’s mom in The Polygamist. So I need to be flexible enough to allow the characters to grow or diminish. Research is also an important part of my writing process. A lot of background research went into The Gold Diggers, and I don’t mean just desktop research. I walked the streets of Johannesburg just like Portia did. I believe the research adds to the authenticity of the book. I am a research analyst and this always filters through into my work. However, the downside is I tend to get carried away with the research and have to remind myself that I am writing a book and not an academic thesis. When I was still a novice writer, I was more meticulous with the planning. I would do a story outline from beginning to end with a chapter by chapter synopsis that I followed religiously. Now the process is more unrefined and I allow the story to unravel as I write. I do get writer’s block and for me it’s simply a sign that something is not working with the plot. So I simply take a step back from writing and I return to it later. I have been unemployed since June 2018. So I have had the luxury of writing every day, dedicating five hours to the craft. When I write, I need total silence, which I get only when my son is at school. When he gets home, I shut the laptop and transform from writer into a desperate house mom. Often I can’t switch off the characters inhabiting my head and the plotting continues. Writing might seem like a lonely craft, but I am not alone because my characters keep me company. I have just completed my third novel and now I can exhale! Sue Nyathi is the author of The Polygamist (Logogog, 2012) and The Gold Diggers (Pan Macmillan, 2018)
