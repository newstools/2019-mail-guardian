I was in accounting for 14 years and then I became a writer. I knew from the time I was a kid that I wanted to write books, but then life happened and I ended up in finance. What prompted me to write was a friend of mine who, in 2010, sent me a message saying: “Makanaka, I am still waiting for the book.” It then prompted me to say: “You know what? I forgot about this dream I had to write this book.” It also happened at a time when I didn’t know whether I was going through some postnatal stuff or what, because I had so many voices inside my head, literally.
I used to write whatever it was down. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>So I created the characters because I knew what the story was going to be. I knew that these ladies were not connected, so I needed the glue to make them exist in the same book, on the same pages. I also had a domestic worker who came in twice a week and she would tell me what was happening in the next house. Then it clicked to me that if I have four fictional ladies who don’t know each other and this lady — the domestic worker in real life — is telling me what is happening in their houses, she is obviously also going to tell them what is happening in my house and so in real life I had to tread carefully around her but in my fictional world I had found the perfect solution and glue for my story. And the story of Maxine was kinda like my journey to say I am leaving accounting. So when she moves from this abusive relationship to go into town, it’s like me leaving accounting to venture into this unknown space of writing. I didn’t have a degree in writing. The only thing that I had was the passion and the characters that I had already created. So when you follow Maxine’s story and how she works with these different women and finding out all of these women’s stories, it’s kind of like a metaphor of what I went through. Some of them were personal experiences but the book is not about me. There are certain aspects of situations that had happened to me that I just brought out. There were some stories that I heard on the train, some stories that I heard in the book club and when I was sitting with other ladies — the usual complaints that we’d have. It got to a point where, if I was driving, I would park on the side of the road to start jotting things down. I had receipts with stuff written on them. I had little books with so much stuff written in them so I could keep the information. Sometimes I’d have to go to the bathroom to record on my phone — or just write notes. The only people who saw the dark side of me were my children, when I was taking them to school or in the night. It was either I would just start talking on my phone or just start writing.
