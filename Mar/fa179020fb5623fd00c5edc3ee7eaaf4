Musician Mandla “Mampintsha” Maphumulo has been released on R2000 bail after being arrested earlier on Tuesday, and has threatened to file counter charges of assault against his estranged long-term partner Bongekile Simelane (Babes Wodumo). Police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo told the Mail & Guardian that no charges have been laid against Simelane. This comes after a video showing Maphumulo physically assaulting Simelane went viral on social media on Sunday night. Speaking to the media outside the Pinetown magistrate’s court, Maphumulo said in Zulu that he was a victim and that Simelane had made him do it.
Maphumulo said he has been in many relationships with women and had never lifted a hand against any of them. The musician said no one has heard his side of the story. <div class="nws-ad-wrapper"><style scoped="true">.nws-ad-wrapper * { -webkit-box-sizing: border-box; box-sizing: border-box; } .nws-ad-wrapper { margin: 30px 0; } .nws-ad-content { border: solid 1px #d8d8d8; overflow: hidden; background: #ffffff !important; } .nws-ad-img { width: 45%; padding-right: 13px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-img { width: 22%; } } .nws-ad-details { width: 55%; padding-right: 9px; padding-left: 9px; float: left; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details { width: 78%; } } .nws-ad-details:hover{ color: #000; } .nws-ad-details h3{ font-size: 100%; margin-top: 10px; } .nws-ad-details p{ color: #000; display: none; font-size: 80%; line-height: 1.5em !important; } @media (min-width: 575px) { .nws-ad-details p{ display: block; } } .nws-ad-img img { width: 100%; height: auto; } .nws-ad-promo { color: #fff; background: #f00; display: inline-block; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: 700; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .02rem; padding: 4px 4px 2px !important; line-height: 1; } .nws-ad-company{ color: #ee2324; font-family: droid sans, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 1;} </style><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12"><a href="${URL}" target="_blank"><div class="nws-ad-content"><div class="nws-ad-img"><img src="${THUMBNAIL}" alt="${TITLE}"></div><div class="nws-ad-details"><div class="nws-ad-promo">Promoted</div><h3>${TITLE}</h3><p>${DESCRIPTION}</p><div class="nws-ad-company">${COMPANY_NAME} | ${DISPLAY_URL}</div></div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div></a></div></div></div></div>He said he was woken by a drunk Simelane when she beat him with a stick. Maphumulo admits that assaulting her was a mistake, but says he was led to do it because she had assaulted him. Simelane’s family spokesperson, Sakhile Langa, declined to comment. The matter will be heard in court on May 15.
